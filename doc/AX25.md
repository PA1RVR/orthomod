# Using AX.25 over OrthoMod

> *AX.25 is a HDLC-variant to pass traffic over a physical
> layer, which might use OrthoMod.  How does it work together?*

The AX.25 design version 2.2 involves a "Link Multiplexer" component
that supports the transmission of packets for different data links
over one physical layer.

Orthogonality enables the same-time transmission to different
recipient identities, and those identities are:

  * a hash of the recipient: for connectionless traffic including connection requests
  * a hash of the transmitter and recipient: for connection-oriented traffic

It is reasonable to consider an OrthoMod radio as a single
physical channel towards the Link Multiplexer, to use different
end point identities in the higher layers and to derive addresses
like these.  Note however, that a connection request must always
be connectionless, and that this leads to a different identity
from the identity for an established connection.  Some knowledge
of the AX.25 content is therefore required to make this mapping.
Given the identity, the multiplexer can decide which requests can
occur in parallel and which cannot.

**TODO:** Look into AX.25 software, and see if this is reasonable.
It certainly is possible when looking at the AX.25 headers, but
it may not integrate well with the API in terms of the scope, origin
and passing-around of identities; it may also not integrate well
with the logic in existing implementations.  That'd be a challenge.

Finally, AX.25 is usually transmitted with NRZI over something like
BPSK, but for TPSK modulation we do not require (nor desire) NRZI.


## AX.25 Frames and their Channel Identities

The
[channel identities](ChannelIdentity.md)
to use with OrthoMod are derived from each
AX.25 frame's header.  Note that even fragmented frames start with
such a header and are otherwise standard `I` and `UI` frames that
happen to have a special idea about the PID Field value and a
corresponding interpretation of the Information Field.

  * `U` can be connection-oriented or not.  See the subclassses
    below: `UI`, `SABME`, `SABM`, `DISC`, `UA`, `DM`, `FRMR`,
    `XID`, `TEST`.

  * `I` is a bit like TCP, in that it supports flow control and
    windowing, and transmissions will be acknowledged.  These frames
    are passed over a connection and will be identified by the
    channel from transmitter to receiver.

  * `S` is the supervisory frame, and is part of connected mode, so
    it is identified by both the transmitter and receiver designation.
    The subclasses of the `S` frame are: `RR`, `RNR`, `REJ`, `SREJ`.

  * `UI` is a bit like UDP, in that it bypasses flow control and
    windowing and will not be acknowledged.  The frame is not part
    of a connection and may in fact be addressing a group address;
    it will be identified by the receiver alone.

  * `SABM` and `SABME` connect two radios.  The transmitter has
    the designation of the receiver (call sign and station
    number) but the receiver does not know about the transmitter's
    designation.  So, these requests are sent over a channel that
    is identified by the receiver designation alone.

  * `DISC` is a disconnection request between two radios.
    This is part of a connection, and so it is identified by both
    the transmitter and receiver designation.

  * `UA` acknowledges a `SABM`, `SABME` or `DISC` command, and are
    considered part of a connection.  It is identified by both the
    transmitter and receiver designation.

  * `DM` signals that the receiver got a frame for connected mode
    which it was operating in disconnected mode, or when a connection
    attempt is rejected for the time being.  It is not considered
    part of a connection and the response will be identified by
    the receiver (of the `DM`) alone.  This is also the easiest way
    to respond to a failure to accept a connection, as it requires
    no temporary setup for a responding channel identity.

  * `FRMR`, `XID` and `TEST`
    are all connected commands, and are identified by the channel
    from transmitter to receiver.

The transmitter should be able to find its own designation in
anything that it about to transmit; from the ones it has been
configured for, it would be the one closest to the destination,
but it must not be the destination.

The receiver designation is the AX.25 address that counts as the
next hop after the last hop with the transmitter designation.

Note that the Address Field contains the destination before the
source, so "closest to the destination" means "first listed" and
"next hop" means "preceding" in terms of the Address Field and
"last hop" is "first in the list".
