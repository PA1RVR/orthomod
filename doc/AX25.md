# Using AX.25 over OrthoMod

The AX.25 design version 2.2 involves a "Link Multiplexer" component
that supports the transmission of packets for different data links
over one physical layer.

Orthogonality enables the same-time transmission to different
recipient identities, and those identities are:

  * a hash of the recipient: for connectionless traffic including connection requests
  * a hash of the transmitter and recipient: for connection-oriented traffic

It is reasonable to consider an OrthoMod radio as a single
physical channel towards the Link Multiplexer, to use different
end point identities in the higher layers and to derive addresses
like these.  Note however, that a connection request must always
be connectionless, and that this leads to a different identity
from the identity for an established connection.  Some knowledge
of the AX.25 content is therefore required to make this mapping.
Given the identity, the multiplexer can decide which requests can
occur in parallel and which cannot.

**TODO:** Look into AX.25 software, and see if this is reasonable.
It certainly is possible when looking at the AX.25 headers, but
it may not integrate well with the API in terms of the scope, origin
and passing-around of identities; it may also not integrate well
with the logic in existing implementations.  That'd be a challenge.

Finally, AX.25 is usually transmitted with NRZI over something like
BPSK, but for TPSK modulation we do not require (nor desire) NRZI.
