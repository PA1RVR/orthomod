<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
The KISS
("Keep It Simple, Stupid")
TNC provides direct computer  to  TNC
communication  using a simple protocol described here.
Many TNCs now implement it, including the  TAPR  TNC-1
and TNC-2 (and their clones), the venerable VADCG TNC,
the AEA PK-232/PK-87 and all TNCs  in  the  Kantronics
line.   KISS has quickly become the protocol of choice
for TCP/IP operation and multi-connect BBS software.

<h2>1.  Introduction</h2>

<p>Standard TNC software was written with human users in mind;
unfortunately,  commands and responses well suited for human use
are ill-adapted for host computer use, and vice versa.  This  is
especially  true  for multi-user servers such as bulletin boards
which must  multiplex  data  from  several  network  connections
across  a  single  host/TNC  link.  In addition, experimentation
with new link level protocols is greatly hampered because  there
may  very well be no way at all to generate or receive frames in
the desired format without reprogramming the TNC.

<p>The KISS TNC solves these problems by eliminating  as  much
as possible from the TNC software, giving the attached host complete
control over and access to the contents of the HDLC frames
transmitted  and  received over the air.  This is central to the
KISS philosophy: the host software should have control over  all
TNC functions at the lowest possible level.

<p>The AX.25 protocol is removed entirely from the TNC, as are
all  command interpreters and the like.  The TNC simply converts
between synchronous HDLC, spoken on  the  full-  or  half-duplex
radio  channel,  and  a  special asynchronous, full duplex frame

format spoken on the host/TNC link.  Every frame received on the
HDLC  link  is  passed  intact  to  the  host  once  it has been
translated to the asynchronous  format;  likewise,  asynchronous
frames  from  the host are transmitted on the radio channel once
they have been converted to HDLC format.

<p>Of course, this means that the bulk of  AX.25  (or  another
protocol)  must  now  be implemented on the host system. This is
acceptable, however, considering the greatly increased flexibility
and reduced overall complexity that comes from allowing the
protocol to reside on the same machine with the applications  to
which it is closely coupled.

<p>It should be stressed that the KISS TNC was  intended  only
as  a  stopgap.   Ideally, host computers would have HDLC interfaces
of their  own,  making  separate  TNCs  unnecessary.
<a href="#15">[15]</a>
Unfortunately,  HDLC  interfaces  are  rare,  although  they are
starting to appear for the  IBM  PC.   The  KISS  TNC  therefore
becomes  the  "next  best thing" to a real HDLC interface, since
the host computer only needs an ordinary asynchronous interface.

<h2>2.  Asynchronous Frame Format</h2>

The "asynchronous packet protocol" spoken between the  host
and  TNC  is  very simple, since its only function is to delimit
frames. Each frame is both preceded and followed  by  a  special
FEND  (Frame  End) character, analogous to an HDLC flag.  No CRC
or checksum is provided.  In addition,  no  RS-232C  handshaking
signals are employed.

<p>The special characters are:


<pre>

Abbreviation            Description                    Hex value
   FEND                 Frame  End                         C0  
   FESC                 Frame  Escape                      DB 
   TFEND                Transposed Frame End               DC 
   TFESC                Transposed Frame Escape            DD
</pre>

<p>The reason for both preceding and ending frames with  FENDs
is  to  improve  performance  when  there is noise on the asynch
line.  The FEND at the beginning of a  frame  serves  to  "flush
out"  any  accumulated garbage into a separate frame (which will
be discarded by the upper layer protocol) instead of sticking it
on  the  front of an otherwise good frame.  As with back-to-back
flags in HDLC, two FEND characters in a row should not be interpreted
as delimiting an empty frame.

<h2>3.  Transparency</h2>

Frames are sent in 8-bit binary; the asynchronous  link  is
set  to  8 data bits, 1 stop bit, and no parity.  If a FEND ever
appears in the data, it is translated into the two byte sequence
FESC  TFEND  (Frame Escape, Transposed Frame End).  Likewise, if
the FESC character ever appears in the user data, it is replaced
with  the two character sequence FESC TFESC (Frame Escape, Transposed
Frame Escape).

<p>As characters arrive at the receiver, they are appended  to
a  buffer  containing the current frame.  Receiving a FEND marks
the end of the current  frame.   Receipt  of  a  FESC  puts  the
receiver  into "escaped mode", causing the receiver to translate
a following TFESC or TFEND back to FESC or  FEND,  respectively,
before adding it to the receive buffer and leaving escaped mode.
Receipt of any character other than  TFESC  or  TFEND  while  in
escaped  mode is an error; no action is taken and frame assembly
continues.  A TFEND or TESC received while not in  escaped  mode
is treated as an ordinary data character.

<p>This procedure may seem somewhat  complicated,  but  it  is
easy  to implement and recovers quickly from errors. In particular,
the FEND character is never sent over the channel except as
an  actual end-of-frame indication. This ensures that any intact
frame (properly delimited by FEND  characters)  will  always  be
received  properly  regardless  of  the  starting  state  of the
receiver or corruption of the preceding frame.

<p>This asynchronous framing protocol is identical  to  "SLIP"
(Serial Line IP), a popular method for sending ARPA IP datagrams
across asynchronous links. It could also form the  basis  of  an
asynchronous  amateur packet radio link protocol that avoids the
complexity of HDLC on slow speed channels.

<h2>4.  Control of the KISS TNC</h2>

<p>Each asynchronous data frame sent to the TNC  is  converted
back  into "pure" form and queued for transmission as a separate
HDLC frame.  Although removing the human interface and the AX.25
protocol  from the TNC makes most existing TNC commands unnecessary
(i.e., they  become  host  functions),  the  TNC  is  still
responsible  for keying the transmitter's PTT line and deferring
to other activity on the radio channel. It is  therefore  necessary
to  allow the host to control a few TNC parameters, namely
the transmitter keyup delay, the transmitter  persistence  variables
and any special hardware that a particular TNC may have.

<p>To distinguish between  command  and  data  frames  on  the
host/TNC link, the first byte of each asynchronous frame between
host and TNC is a "type" indicator.  This type indicator byte is
broken into two 4-bit nibbles so that the low-order nibble indicates
the command number (given in  the  table  below)  and  the
high-order  nibble indicates the port number for that particular
command.  In systems with only one HDLC port, it is  by  definition
Port  0.  In multi-port TNCs, the upper 4 bits of the type
indicator byte can specify one of up to sixteen ports.  The following
commands are defined in frames to the TNC  (the "Command"
field is in hexadecimal):

<pre>
Command        Function         Comments  
   0           Data frame       The  rest  of the frame is data to
                                be sent on the HDLC channel.   

   1           TXDELAY          The next  byte  is  the  transmitter
                                keyup  delay  in  10 ms units.  
                		The default start-up value is 50
                                (i.e., 500 ms). 

   2           P                The next byte  is  the  persistence
                                parameter,  p, scaled to the range 
                                0 - 255 with the following
                                formula:

                                         P = p * 256 - 1 

                                The  default  value  is  P  =  63  
                                (i.e.,  p  =  0.25).  
 
   3           SlotTime         The next byte is the slot interval 
                                in 10 ms units.
                                The default is 10 (i.e., 100ms). 

   4           TXtail           The next byte is the time to hold 
                                up the TX after the FCS has been 
                                sent, in 10 ms units.  This command
                                is obsolete, and is included  here 
                                only for  compatibility  with  some
                                existing  implementations.  
 
   5          FullDuplex        The next byte is 0 for half duplex,
                                nonzero  for full  duplex.  
                                The  default  is  0  
                                (i.e.,  half  duplex).  

   6          SetHardware       Specific for each TNC.  In the 
                                TNC-1, this command  sets  the 
                                modem speed.  Other implementations
                                may use this function  for   other
                                hardware-specific   functions.  
    
   FF         Return            Exit KISS and return control to a 
                                higher-level program. This is useful
                                only when KISS is  incorporated  
                                into  the TNC along with other 
                                applications.  
</pre>

<p>The following types are defined in frames to the host:

<pre>
Type			Function		Comments  
    
  0                 Data frame       Rest of frame is data from
                                     the HDLC channel.
</pre>

<p>No other types are defined; in particular, there is no provision
for acknowledging data or command frames sent to the TNC.
KISS implementations must ignore any unsupported command  types.
All  KISS implementations must implement commands 0,1,2,3 and 5;
the others are optional.

<h2>5.  Buffer and Packet Size Limits</h2>

<p>One of the things that makes the KISS  TNC  simple  is  the
deliberate lack of TNC/host flow control. The host computers run
a higher level protocol (typically TCP, but AX.25  in  the  connected
mode  also  qualifies)  that  handles flow control on an
end-to-end basis.  Ideally,  the  TNC  would  always  have  more
buffer  memory  than  the sum of all the flow control windows of
all of the logical connections using it  at  that  moment.  This
would  allow  for the worst case (i.e., all users sending simultaneously).
In practice, however, many (if not most) user  connections
are idle for long periods of time, so buffer memory may
be safely "overbooked".  When the occasional "bump" occurs,  the
TNC  must  drop  the  packet gracefully, i.e., ignore it without
crashing or losing packets already  queued.   The  higher  level
protocol   is   expected   to   recover  by  "backing  off"  and
retransmitting the packet at a later time, just as it does whenever
a  packet is lost in the network for any other reason.  As
long as this occurs infrequently, the performance degradation is
slight;  therefore the TNC should provide as much packet buffering
as possible, limited only by available RAM.

<p>Individual packets at  least  1024  bytes  long  should  be
allowed.   As  with  buffer  queues,  it  is recommended that no
artificial limits be placed on packet size.   For  example,  the
K3MC  code  running  on  a  TNC-2  with  32K of RAM can send and
receive 30K byte packets, although  this  is  admittedly  rather
extreme.   Large  packets reduce protocol overhead on good channels.
They are essential for good performance when operating  on
high speed modems such as the new WA4DSY 56 kbps design.


<h2>6.  Persistence</h2>

<p>The P and SlotTime parameters are used  to  implement  true
p-persistent CSMA.  This works as follows:

<p>Whenever the host queues data  for  transmission,  the  TNC
begins  monitoring  the carrier detect signal from the modem. It
waits indefinitely for this signal  to  go  inactive.  When  the
channel  clears, the TNC generates a random number between 0 and
1.
<a href="#2">[2]</a>
If this number is less than or equal to the parameter p,
the  TNC  keys the transmitter, waits .01 * TXDELAY seconds, and
transmits all queued frames. The TNC then unkeys the transmitter
and  goes  back  to  the  idle  state.   If the random number is
greater than p, the TNC delays  .01  *  SlotTime  seconds  and
repeats the procedure beginning with the sampling of the carrier
detect signal. (If the carrier detect signal has gone active  in
the  meantime,  the  TNC again waits for it to clear before continuing).
Note that p = 1 means  "transmit  as  soon  as  the
channel clears"; in this case the p-persistence algorithm degenerates
into the 1-persistent CSMA generally used by conventional
AX.25 TNCs.

<p>p-persistence causes the TNC to wait for an  exponentially-distributed
random  interval after sensing that the channel has
gone clear before attempting to transmit. With proper tuning  of
the  parameters  p and SlotTime, several stations with traffic
to send are much less likely to collide  with  each  other  when
they  all see the channel go clear.  One transmits first and the
others see it in time to prevent a collision,  and  the  channel
To conform to the literature, here p  takes  on values between 0 
to 1. However, fractions are difficult to use in a fixed point 
microprocessor so the KISS  TNC actually works with P values that 
are rescaled to the range 0 to  255.   To  avoid  confusion,  we  
will  use lower-case  p to mean the former (0-1) and upper-case
P whenever we mean the latter (0-255).
remains stable under heavy load.   See  references
<a href="#1">[1]</a>
through
<a href="#13">[13]</a>
for details.

<p>We believe that optimum p and SlotTime  values  could  be
computed  automatically.  This could be done by noting the channel
occupancy and the length of the frames on the  channel.   We
are  proceeding with a simulation of the p-persistence algorithm
described here that we  hope  will  allow  us  to  construct  an
automatic algorithm for p and SlotTime selection.

<p>We added p-persistence to the KISS TNC  because  it  was  a
convenient  opportunity to do so.  However, it is not inherently
associated with KISS nor with  new  protocols  such  as  TCP/IP.
Rather,  persistence is a channel access protocol that can yield
dramatic performance improvements regardless of the higher level
protocol  in  use;  we urge it be added to every TNC, whether or
not it supports KISS.

<h2>7.  Implementation History</h2>

<p>The original idea for a simplified host/TNC protocol is due to
Brian Lloyd, WB6RQN.  Phil Karn, KA9Q, organized the specification and
submitted an initial version on 6 August 1986.  As of this writing,
the following KISS TNC implementations exist:

<pre>

                                               as  of  21 Jan 1987.

The special commands "KISS ON" and "KISS OFF" (!) control entry 
into KISS mode.  

Kantronics             Mike  Huslig             Integrated  into  
                                                standard Kantronics
                                                firmware as of July
                                                1987.
</pre>

<p>The AEA and Kantronics implementations  are  noteworthy  in
that  the  KISS  functions  were  written  by  those vendors and
integrated into their standard  TNC  firmware.  Their  TNCs  can
operate  in  either  KISS  or  regular  AX.25  mode  without ROM
changes.  Since the TNC-1 and TNC-2 KISS versions  were  written
by  different  authors  than  the  original  AX.25 firmware, and
because the original source code for those  TNCs  was  not  made
available,  running KISS on these TNCs requires the installation
of nonstandard ROMs. Two ROMs are available for the  TNC-2.  One
contains "dedicated" KISS TNC code; the TNC operates only in the
KISS  mode.  The  "download"  version  contains  standard   N2WX
firmware with a bootstrap loader overlay. When the TNC is turned
on or reset, it executes the loader. The loader  will  accept  a
memory  image  in Intel Hex format, or it can be told to execute
the standard N2WX firmware  through  the  "H"
<a href="#3">[3]</a>command.   The
download version is handy for occasional KISS  operation,  while
the  dedicated  version is much more convenient for full-time or
demo KISS operation.

<p>The code for the TNC-1 is also available in  both  download
and  dedicated  versions.  However,  at present the download ROM
contains only a bootstrap; the original ROMs must be put back in
to run the original TNC software.
